                <h2>Difference between authorization and authentication</h2>
                <p>Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can come on board. The first step is to confirm the identity of a passenger to make sure they are who they say they are.</p>

            <p>Firebase, Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), is a platform by Google that provides functionalities and helps with the backend development of your Android, iOS, or web and even some products that support Unity3D too.</p>
            <h4>What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h4>
            <p>Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.</p>
